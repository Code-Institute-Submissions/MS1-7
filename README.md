# AMH Beauty
 A website designed for a friend of mine, Ashleigh Hocking

Ashleigh is a fully qualified and practicing beautician with many treatments to offer.
This website is designed to showcase some off Ashleighs work in the form of a 'Treatments'
section while also having an area dedicated to infomation about herself and links to constantly
updating social media. 

## UX
---
This webpage is primarly targeted to a female audience while also allowing the involvement
of men, you can see this by male client photos, this is to make men feel more comfortable.

When loading the webpage, the users are greeted with a large hero image which showcases 
Ashleighs work.

With the presentation of the hero image, the selected fonts, text, colour scheme and logo, users get a clear indication that they are
on a page dedicated to beauty treatments.

   - To allow for effortless navivation through the pages, i added bootstraps navbar which can be found [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/).
