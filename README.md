# AMH Beauty


Ashleigh is a fully qualified and practicing beautician with many treatments to offer.
This website is designed to showcase some off Ashleighs work in the form of a 'Treatments'
section while also having an area dedicated to infomation about herself and links to constantly
updating social media. 

## UX
---
This webpage is primarly targeted to a female audience while also allowing the involvement
of men, you can see this by male client photos, this is to make men feel more comfortable.

When loading the webpage, the users are greeted with a large hero image which showcases 
Ashleighs work.

With the presentation of the hero image, the selected fonts, text, colour scheme and logo, users get a clear indication that they are
on a page dedicated to beauty treatments.

## Features
---

- Bootstrap Navbar

   - To allow for effortless navivation through the pages, i added bootstraps navbar which can be found [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/).

   - The navbar contains 3 links on mobile display (HOME/TREATMENTS/ABOUT) and 4 links on desktop view (previous 3 plus business logo directing back to HOME).  

   - When the navbar is being displayed on screens less than 992px in width, its collapses into a dropdown menu which is activated and expanded when pressing the burger icon in the top right. 

- Explore Button 

   - The Explore Button is our home page call-to-action. Upon being clicked, you will be directed to the to the TREATMENTS page. 

   - The Explore Button has been achieved by using Bootstraps .btn class within the 'a' attribute, as seen [here](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_buttons.asp).

- Footer Links

   - The footer contains fully functioning links to the AMH Beauty Facebook and Instagram pages and a booking email template. The icons have been taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

- Treatments showcased

   - These are the most popular sellers for AMH Beauty and have therefore been showcased with their own sections dedicated to displaying the image for users of the quality of her work. 

   - The sections also contain the pricing and buttons that will take them to the booking form. 

- Bootstrap Carousel 

   - The carousel has been added to add more impact on to viewers who are intrested in the detail of the work and are even greeted by a male pictured in Ashleighs work.

   - The code for the carousel was taken from Bootstrap and can be viewed [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/carousel/)

- Booking Form 

   - Here, users are able to book their desired treatment from a drop down selection menu and are also clearly informed that they will need to fill out their details in the other fields with placeholder text.

   - All fields on the form have the required attribute meaning the user will not be able to submit the form with missing data.


## Technologies Used
---
- HTML5

   - Used to add and structure content

- CSS

   - Used to style content

- Bootstrap 

   - Used for aid in structuring code and adding in pre-existing templates for Navbar, carousel and booking form.

   - I also took full advantage of bootstraps grid system to enable smoother transitions across multiple devices widths.

- Font Awesome 

   - I have used 3 icons from Font Awesome for links in the footer of the page. 

- Google Fonts 

   - the google fonts that were used are as listed below:
   
        Playfair Display

        https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display?query=playfair
   
        Dancing Script

- Google Chrome Developer Tools

   - Google Chrome Developer Tools were used throughout the process as an aid to make ure that all changes that were being implimented, worked properly. Also to test responsiveness on other device sizes. 

- HMTL Validator 

   - ![html validator check](assets/images/AMH_Beauty_htmlvalidator.png "HTML Validator Check")


- CSS Validator

   - CSS Validator was used here also, but as you can see below, the resulting errors are due to the Bootstrap URI.
